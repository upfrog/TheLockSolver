# TheLockSolver
Given a lock which requires an ordered series of actions to open, and then uses several different algorithms to find the solution

To run the program, first download all files, and then compile them in your environment of choice. Then, run Driver.java. To change the maximum length of solution the algorithms will be tasked with finding, change the MAXDEPTH value in Driver.java
